  <p class="rules">To play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent, you can follow the same rules as playing against another
  person. Here's how the game can be played between a user and a computer:
  <br>
  <br>

  
  1. The user and the computer both make their selections by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
  <br>
  <br>
  2. Both selections are revealed simultaneously.
  <br>
  <br>
  3. Determine the winner based on the following rules: <br>
  - Rock beats Scissors <br>
  - Scissors beats Paper <br>
  - Paper beats Rock.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  4. Display the result of the round, whether it's a win, loss, or a tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  5. Keep track of the scores for the user and the computer.
  <br>
  <br>
  6. Repeat the process for the desired number of rounds or until a predetermined score is reached to determine the
  overall winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Here's an example of how a round could play out:
  <br>
  <br>
  
  User selects: Rock
  Computer selects: Scissors
  <br>
  <br>
  
  
  Since Rock beats Scissors, the user wins the round.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  
  Remember to randomize the computer's selection so that it doesn't always make the same choice. This adds an element of
  unpredictability to the game. You can assign a random number to each option (rock, paper, scissors) and have the
  computer select the option corresponding to that number.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The game continues until the desired number of rounds is played, or until a predetermined score is reached.</p>
